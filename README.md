# Find a B Corp

### What the project does
Find a B Corp was built to help me learn R shiny and to help me find the top ranked B Corps in an industry in which I might be shopping for something. It ain't pretty, yet, but it's mine!  

* The original data came from [Data World](https://data.world/blab/b-corp-impact-data)  
* Original build timeline: A weekend in December, 2022
* Packages involved: 
  + shiny
  + shinydashboard
  + ggplot2
  + leaflet
  + tidygeocoder
  + dplyr
  + lubridate
  + stringr
  + tidyverse

### Why the project is useful
The app makes it easier for shoppers to find B Corps when they're searching for something. Say you need socks. You can easily find the top 10 apparel B Corps, then go check out their products! 

### How users can get started with the project
Feel free to take the code and modify your own version. I'd prefer that my original version only be modified by me as I continue to learn and refine my design.
